    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my page! I'm Nithesh Kumar, a Ph.D. candidate at Clemson University in Electrical Engineering, specializing in robotics and innovative electromechanical design. I am passionate about advancing robotics and creating complex robotic systems, currently focusing on Robot Rooms—multifunctional spaces that dynamically adjust to user needs. This project is in response to the growing housing crisis and limited space in urban environments. Robot Rooms are adaptive living spaces designed to maximize functionality and efficiency, offering a scalable solution for compact, urban housing.</p>

<p>This work combines my expertise in SolidWorks modeling, prototyping, 3D printing, and hardware design to create a transformative living environment that meets modern spatial challenges. My prior projects have involved developing hybrid robotic grippers for rapid grasping and optical sensors for colorimetric biosensing, allowing me to apply skills in 3D modeling and rapid prototyping to create practical, advanced solutions for robotics and sensing applications.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical expertise, I bring three years of industry experience as a Hardware Electrical Engineer at Fiber Mountain and as an Electrical Engineering Intern at Timex Group. I hold a Six Sigma Green Belt certification and have AGILE project management experience, which strengthens my qualifications for both R&D and Project Engineering roles.</p>
